            An image is a visual representation of something. It can be two-dimensional, 
            three-dimensional, or somehow otherwise feed into the visual system to convey 
            information. An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other 
            two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject. In the context of signal 
            processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color.
